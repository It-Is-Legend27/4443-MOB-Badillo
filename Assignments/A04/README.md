## Assignment  4 - Final Project Proposal
## Sword Quest Online
### Inspiration:
My inspiration for this app is the hit mobile game, Pokemon Go.
- **Needs**: must have this ability or system will not be useful.
- **Wants**: would be very nice but not absolutely necessary right now.
- **Wishes**: self explanatory

- Requirements:
  - User needs the ability to register and login.
  - I need multiple screens, login, register, quest log, map, etc.
  - I need there to be an inventory system.
  - I wish for there to be character creation.
  - User needs the ability to view Google Maps.
  - User needs the ablity to view the AR scene.
  - App needs location, camera, and mobile data / internet permissions.
  - I need the app to have "side quests", which should either be predefined or randomly generated.
  - I wish for the app to have some trading or dueling mechanic amongst players nearby.
  - I want there to be a "shop" for items, and an XP system. If not, I need there to be a simple quest completion reward system.
  - I need there to be a "quest log" that shows the user's current quests.
  - I want the Google Maps to be styled differently than what the standard Google Maps app is. For example, I want the user's location to be a character icon, or the like. Furthermore, I want the maps to be more visually appealing, similar to the maps in the hit mobile game of 2016, Pokemon Go.
